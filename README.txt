Load a Remote Dashboard Welcome page from a central server to show to your users on their own website.

== Description ==
**THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED**. This plugin loads a (remote) page in the dashboard of the user. The main purpose is to be able to show all your clients the same dashboard welcome, while you\'re still able to update the content of the page on a central location.
While it works without it, it is designed to work in conjunction with the module RBS Remote Dashboard Welcome Control (https://roadbearstudios.com/plugins/rbs-remote-dashboard-welcome-control).

== Installation ==
Upload the package contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.

Or login to WordPress. Go to Plugins -> Add New and upload the zip-file of the plugin. Then activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
